    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook the meat, onion, garlic in a dutch oven or pan
            until all is well browned.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste,
            and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons of parsley,
            basil, add in 1 teaspoon (big spoon) salt, Italian seasoning,
            fennel seeds, and pepper. Cover the pot, and simmer for 1.5 hours
            while stirring occasionally so that it doesn't burn the bottom
            of the pot.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil.
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
            Then drain the noodles, and rinse with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
            remianing 2 tablespoons parsley, and 0.5 teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1.5 cups of meat sauce in the 
            bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
            lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.
            Spread with 0.5 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 
            0.33 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 cups meat 
            sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 0.25 cup parmesan
            cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarrella and
            Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
            either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the 
            foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove
            the foil and bake for an addition 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving</li>
