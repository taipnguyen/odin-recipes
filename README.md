Recipe projects for the The Odin Project

This current project is to learn more about basic html 
and the various tags I can use for different purposes.
Ulitmately, I want to be able to better draft a message 
or poem in my mind and be able to write it down on a website
in a easy and simple way. This would be a huge improvement
from my current strategy of brute forcing my thoughts on a website 
and hastily pasting html tags wherever I think is useful.
